# LaTex templates

## Code Format 
Holds code that can be used to create coloured listings in LaTeX documents with the ```\include{}``` command -- which copies and pastes in whatever ```.tex``` file you feed it.

## Math Macros
Storage of mathematics macros to allow the presentation of common mathematical operations just the way I like them.

## Note Taking
Macros for using LaTeX for taking notes. Notably the ```\qanda{}{}``` command pastes questions at the end of the file and awaits input for answers. Good for follow-up when you're in the midst of taking notes.
